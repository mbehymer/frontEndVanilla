## Connect to NodeJSServer

I use this to interact with the server


### TODO
 -- Fix How the viewManager works, I think it would be good to have it work with components rather than just rendering the whole page.
 -- Rework how the entire App is working so that I can include an agent view pair (basically a set of Javascript code and a template of HTML for that specific piece)
 -- Finish working on the form to get that working so that it will only show information in the fields if the user already has values there. Otherwise it should be blank. Also work on the form so that it will submit be able to submit the data and do so correctly
